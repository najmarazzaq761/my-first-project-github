🚀 **We just submitted our project for the TRAE AI Zero Limit Hackathon!** 💥

Our team took on the challenge to simplify DevOps using the power of AI—and we proudly present **Auto-DevOps Agent** 🤖💡

🔧 **What is it?**
Auto-DevOps Agent is a multi-agent system powered by LLMs (via Groq + OpenAI SDK) that:

* Auto-detects your project’s stack (Python, Node, etc.)
* Generates full CI/CD workflows in GitHub Actions YAML
* Adds build, test, and deploy stages automatically
* Explains every step in plain English for better understanding

💡 Whether you're building a simple app or launching a full-stack product, this tool helps you skip the DevOps pain and jump straight to shipping — no YAML expertise required!

🛠 **Tech Stack:**

* Frontend: React.js
* Backend: FastAPI
* LLMs: Groq + OpenAI (LLaMA 3.1 8B)
* DevOps: GitHub Actions, YAML, Docker (optional)
* Agents: StackDetector, TestAgent, BuildAgent, YAMLWriter, ExplainAgent

🛤️ **What’s next?**
In our future updates, we plan to:

* Add one-click deployment to platforms like Vercel, Railway, Render
* Automate GitHub Secrets management
* Support private repo access and commit-push from the agent itself
